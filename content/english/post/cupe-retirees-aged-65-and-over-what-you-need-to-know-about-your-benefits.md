CUPE Retirees Aged 65 and Over:

What You Need to Know About Your Benefits

When employees of CUPE retire, they and their dependents continue to receive the same benefit coverage they had while working. This is a benefit that was negotiated for you by your employee union.

Once you turn 65, however, retirees in some provinces are eligible for benefits under their public provincial health insurance plan. Many provinces offer additional health benefit coverage to seniors aged 65 and over and this can affect your coverage under the CUPE sponsored Green Shield Canada (GSC) plan.

This Fact Sheet highlights how provincial health insurance plans impact your prescription drug and eye exam GSC benefits at age 65.

**Prescription Drug Coverage**

Most provinces have special prescription drug coverage for seniors aged 65 and over. In some provinces, the coverage is only for low-income seniors. This table summarizes what each province provides and how the plan coordinates with our GSC plan.
