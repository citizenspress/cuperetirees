News from the CUPE Staff Retirees Association
July 2023         

Sisters and Brothers,

We intended to have a short early summer newsletter, but there’s a lot happening! Please take a few minutes to read right through.

Benefits

We’d like to remind everyone again that most dental work requires a pre-determination. Be sure your dentist’s office submits that before work is done. Also, it’s worth checking before you order prescription glasses, hearing aids or other devices that GSC will cover the charges from your supplier. Unfortunately, it seems some businesses have submitted fraudulent claims in the past and are blacklisted by GSC. 

Most of you received an email in May from GSC with the news that the company managing our travel insurance claims has changed from Allianz to CanAssistance. Coverage has not changed and the number to call for information or to make a claim remains the same as the one on the back of your Green Shield ID card.

In response to some questions that have been raised, we have been informed that this is an industry-wide change and not restricted to GSC. Allianz has quit the travel insurance business.

There has been some concern about the pre-trip eligibility mentioned in the email. This is a reminder that our coverage is for emergency medical care only. The benefits booklet lists many exclusions, starting with “any expenses incurred for the treatment related directly or indirectly to a pre-existing or pre-diagnosed medical condition that, at the time of your departure from your province of residence, was not completely stable.”

CUPE staff put the question to GSC and received this response:

The pre-trip eligibility service will allow members to be able to confirm if they meet the criteria to be stable for travel. This will remove any doubt for members that may be uncertain of what stable means.

So what does “stable” mean? We asked GSC and received the following:

A general rule to determine length of time for determining stability is 90 days prior to leaving your home province. Here are some of the considerations when determining stability: 

•         Patient was not having acute, ongoing symptoms prior to departure
•         Patient has not had a change in treatment, new treatment or change in prescribed medication
•         Patient was not seeking new, or a change in treatment just prior to departure
•         Patient was not waiting for further work up related to the symptoms they were experiencing
•         Patient travels against the medical advice of his/her Primary Care Physician
•         Patient would be in between treatments that historically cause them to have complications & untoward side effects
•         Patient anticipates the need for medical care while traveling

We also contacted CanAssistance where a representative advised that anyone with a medical condition that has been stable for 90 days should get a doctor’s letter to that effect and carry it with them while travelling. 

In any case, if you seek a pre-trip eligibility determination, CanAssistance will not tell you that you cannot travel but may advise that you purchase additional travel insurance if you have a condition that may require medical treatment.

If you have questions or problems related to benefits, please contact Fanie Corriveau-Leclerc, fcorriveau-leclerc@cupe.ca, 613-237-1590.

EAP - Employee Assistance Plan

As of today, retirees now have access to our Employee Assistance Program (EAP) page through CUPEConnect.

You should have received an email from EAP.  In case you were missed, this is what was sent:

Our EAP page provides staff and retirees with updates on a convenient and user-friendly interface to access a range of resources and tools. Through this platform, retirees will have access to wellness promotions related to your EAP, including counselling services, educational materials, and updates on contact information for EAP staff and referral agents. We believe that this enhanced access to the EAP page will further support your well-being during your retirement years.

In order access EAP on CUPEConnectShould any eligible retiree have difficulty with accessing the EAP page through steps provided, they should contact the help desk; itservicedesk.cupe@novanetworks.com

CUPE National Convention

Those who retired after 2019 from positions that have traditionally been invited to a ‘final’ CUPE convention should have received their letters last month. Delegates will gather in Quebec City, October 23-27.

We are working through CUPE National to set a time and location for a retirees’ meeting, possibly on the same day as recognition of retirees is on the convention agenda. We are also looking into some kind of social event such as a lunch or reception for all members in attendance since the CSU will not host a retirees’ luncheon this year. Stay tuned for more news.

Speaking of meetings …

With the pandemic behind us (fingers crossed), getting together is one of the best ways to build on the activism you’ve already shown through picket line support, signing petitions in favour of pension legislation and other actions. We’ve encouraged chapter reps to find opportunities to meet in our regions and have seen people out in Quebec and Ontario.

Mid-May, almost 30 people turned out in Quebec City during the SCFP Québec convention for a lunch meeting. All retirees in Quebec come out of six or seven different unions depending on the date of their retirement and the position held at the time of retirement and some are not represented by any union. That means the main place to share interests is the CSRA. Those at the meeting said they would like to see more frequent, if shorter, newsletters and web site updates. Also, since CSU is the only staff union with a retiree rep on the executive, it is important to establish relationships and remain current with the bargaining timetables in order to make our concerns known. There was interest in holding virtual meetings so that people can get together without the travel.

A similar number attended a meeting in early June either in person or via Zoom during the CUPE Ontario convention. We have to thank CUPE Ontario for providing the room, equipment, and technical support that allowed us to have this hybrid meeting. There was good discussion about benefits and pensions including some improvements that could be put forward for the next round of bargaining. That conversation will continue. Members also discussed ways of mobilizing within local communities. They saw the Facebook group as an important place to share information.
